# Commit Message Tags

I have mainly two types of repositories: collection of notes from my studies,
and projects. These tags represents all possible types of commits but there's
no need to have all of them in a repo. Some are more granular while some are
more inclusive to suit all purposes.

There are repos that pre-date this convention and some have a simpler version
that is still followed in them for consistency.

Check tags for notes [here](Notes.md) and projects [here](Projects.md)
